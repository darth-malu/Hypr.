-----------BIND---------------
l -> locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
r -> release, will trigger on release of a key.
e -> repeat, will repeat when held.
n -> non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
m -> mouse, see below.
t -> transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
i -> ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
s -> separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](#keysym-combos) above.
d -> has description, will allow you to write a description for your bind.
p -> bypasses the app's requests to inhibit keybinds.


----------DISPATCHER---------------
https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dispatchers/#list-of-dispatchers

    #m- non empty - only search on monitor
